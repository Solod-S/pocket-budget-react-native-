**Main Technologies:**

â€“ React Native: A popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to write native apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase, ensuring seamless performance and a consistent user experience.

â€“ TypeScript: TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing developers with enhanced tooling and error checking. Designed for building large-scale applications, it helps catch potential issues early through type annotations, making code more robust and maintainable. TypeScript seamlessly integrates with JavaScript, enabling incremental adoption while improving developer productivity and collaboration.

â€“ Expo: A powerful framework and platform for developing React Native applications. It offers a managed workflow, over-the-air updates, and access to native APIs without requiring native code, simplifying the development process.

â€“ React Intl: A robust internationalization library for React, used to localize applications with support for multiple languages. Enables seamless translation of text, dates, and numbers, ensuring smooth multilingual experiences. In this project, it handles localization for 5 languages.

â€“ React Native Vector Icons: A library providing a vast collection of customizable vector icons for React Native applications. It supports multiple icon sets, enabling developers to easily enhance UI elements with scalable icons.

â€“ React Native Reanimated: A high-performance animation library that enables smooth and fluid animations using the native thread, improving user experience with seamless transitions and interactions.

â€“ Firebase: A comprehensive platform by Google that provides backend services such as authentication, real-time databases, cloud storage, and push notifications, enabling seamless app development and scalability.

â€“ Zustand: A state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the app's state in a predictable way using a single global store, with actions and reducers, and is commonly used in React Native applications to manage complex state logic.

â€“ Lottie (lottie-react-native): A library for rendering high-quality vector animations in React Native. It allows developers to use JSON-based animations created in Adobe After Effects, improving app interactivity and visual appeal.

â€“ React Native Toast Message: A simple and customizable toast notification library for React Native, making it easy to display quick messages, alerts, and confirmations in mobile applications.
